Spring project for database course.

Spring project for database course. I created this project for my database course, but as I was putting more work into it,
I started thinking maybe this will be a good example of my knowledge and coding skills. Not, even that I already finish that course,
I'm working on it to make it perfect. I know it isn't, but it's better than looking at my other projects that I've done 
sometimes in one day. I know that they are terrible ;)
